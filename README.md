# yabai-game
This site is a play page made with Scratch and based on yabai-game. When you open the site, a feather symbol will appear (loading).
After that, the play screen will appear. Press the green flag button to start, the orange button to pause and play, and the red button to cancel. 
If the game is over, press the green corner at the top left again to play. 
To play, touch or click the screen to make your avatar jump and collect points such as pink balls while trying not to fall off the ground. 
After a while, a person in white clothes will appear, but if you don't jump over him, the game will be over. 
Also, this was added purely for fun, but you can use the official cheat by pressing the spacebar.
Have a good gaming life!
